## Total Drama Island: King's Reign

  On the 24th, bells with chime, swords will be sharpened, blood shall be drawn. The time will come when the Kingdom open its doors of the Arena. A clash will be held for THE FIGHT of the next KING! This is not an easy task, as has been said before, if you want to leave now then you shall, but may I remind you this will be your ONLY chance to get power like this ever. again.
 
This will be a fierce battle as you will face quests that could bring you advantages, and put your forth of your fellow opponents, some humiliating, some life-threatening, its all part of the task to see who will be placed upon this next throne, and bestow the legacy of a true king.
